                    <p>DxT Appliances was founded in 1996 by Tim Scott who still works for and owns the company today. It started off as a bit of extra income for Tim. His professional and friendly attitude soon got people talking and mostly via word of mouth he was able to quit his full time job and build on DxT.</p>
                    <p>After 12 years of going it alone, he had more work sheets in the office than he could handle. Debbie was brought on board to help keep all of the paperwork under control and became the voice of the company very quickly. After securing contracts with local estate agents DxT was ready to take on a second employee, Jack.</p>
                    <p>Jack was a fast and competent learner and had held a full driving license since he was 17 which made him a valuable asset to DxT. After a year of rigorous training he was out doing jobs of his own and getting to know our clients. After having nothing but good feedback about Jacks work, DxT decided it was time to take on more engineers to help with the demand.</p>
                    <p>We now have 4 engineers on the road along with 2 full time employees in the office. DxT has begun to stretch across the South-East in an attempt to cover as many areas as humanly possible so that we may continue providing an excellent service to even more customers.</p>
